# Reversi Minimax Agent
Here, we write a Reversi-playing minimax agent using Python. The agent is capable of playing games using board sizes 6x6, 8x8, 10x10, 12x12, and beats random agents 99.8 percent of the time! Performs admirably against human players, with performace for each board size being tailored using weights/penalties for certain moves. Below is the documentation on this project, but if you'd like to view it in latex, you can download the file:

# Collaboration
This Minimax agent was a joint effort between I, Jack Parry-Wingfield and Mira Kandlikar-Bloch. Neither of us claim any credit for the other files, which were provided as starter code to start and run the Reversi game, load the GUI, and create the human and random agent opponents. This starter code cand be found and accessed at
