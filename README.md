# ReversiMinimaxAgent
Here, we write a Reversi-playing minimax agent using Python. The agent is capable of playing games using board sizes 6x6, 8x8, 10x10, 12x12, and beats random agents 99.8 percent of the time! Performs admirably against human players, with performace for each board size being tailored using weights/penalties for certain moves.
